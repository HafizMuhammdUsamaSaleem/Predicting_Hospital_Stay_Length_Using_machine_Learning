# Predicting_Hospital_Stay_Length_Using_machine_Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project focused on predicting the length of hospital stay for patients. The project utilizes a linear regression approach to analyze various features such as age, sex, respiratory rate, number of days on oxygen, and number of days on a ventilator. By understanding the factors that contribute to the length of hospitalization, the model aims to provide valuable insights to healthcare providers for better resource allocation and patient management

## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the length of hospital stay of  patients based on several key factors. By leveraging a linear regression algorithm, we aim to uncover relationships between patient attributes (age, sex) and medical indicators (respiratory rate, days on oxygen, days on ventilator) with the duration of hospitalization. This predictive tool can assist healthcare institutions in efficiently allocating resources and providing personalized care to patients, especially during critical times.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises health records of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. It includes anonymized patient information such as age, sex, respiratory rate, number of days on oxygen, and number of days on a ventilator, along with the corresponding length of hospital stay. The data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which adds a temporal dimension to the analysis, potentially revealing patterns specific to that period.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset to gain insights into feature distributions and potential correlations.

3. Feature Selection: Identified relevant features for the prediction task based on EDA and domain knowledge.

4. Model Development: Utilized linear regression to build a predictive model for hospital stay length.

5. Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) Root Mean Squarred Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

## Results

The trained linear regression model achieved promising results in predicting the length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. The model's insights can potentially contribute to better resource management and patient care strategies during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic.
